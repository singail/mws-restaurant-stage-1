#### _Three Stage Course Material Project - Restaurant Reviews_

## Project Overview: Stage 1

This project is a part of the Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree Program of Udacity. For the **Restaurant Reviews** project, I had to convert a static webpage to a responsive web application. To complete the task I had to make the webpage and all its contents visible at any viewport(desktop, mobile, tablet). I also made the site accessible for screen reader use and added a service worker so that all visited pages would be accessible offline.

### How to run the page?

1. You need to start up a simple HTTP server to serve up the site files on your local computer. Python has some simple tools to do this, and you don't even need to know Python. For most people, it's already installed on your computer. 

In a terminal, check the version of Python you have: `python -V`. If you have Python 2.x, spin up the server with `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000` (or some other port, if port 8000 is already in use.) For Python 3.x, you can use `python3 -m http.server 8000`. If you don't have Python installed, navigate to Python's [website](https://www.python.org/) to download and install the software.

2. With your server running, visit the site: `http://localhost:8000`, and look around for a bit to see what the current experience looks like.
